### What is Med Cabinet?

Med Cabinet is an app for people who are new to using cannabis as a way to curtail certain medical conditions
and ailments.  This app will help patients find the right strain for them, and give a description of the strain as well as 
the effects, flavor and type. This app was built using Flask, as well as a PostgreSQL database hosted on ElephantSQL.  
My team was asked to build the Flask app and the Postgres database. The DS team in Unit 4 was responsible for the model 
used in this app.
